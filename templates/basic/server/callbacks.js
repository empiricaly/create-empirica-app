// => onSet, onAppend and onChange ==========================================
// ===========================================================================

// onSet, onAppend and onChange are called on every single update made by all
// players in each game, so they can rapidly become quite expensive and have
// the potential to slow down the app. Use wisely.
//
// It is very useful to be able to react to each update a user makes. Try
// nontheless to limit the amount of computations and database saves (.set)
// done in these callbacks. You can also try to limit the amount of calls to
// set() and append() you make (avoid calling them on a continuous drag of a
// slider for example) and inside these callbacks use the `key` argument at the
// very beginning of the callback to filter out which keys your need to run
// logic against.
//
// If you are not using these callbacks, comment them out so the system does
// not call them for nothing.

// // onSet is called when the experiment code call the .set() method
// // on games, rounds, stages, players, playerRounds or playerStages.
// Empirica.onSet((
//   game,
//   round,
//   stage,
//   player, // Player who made the change
//   target, // Object on which the change was made (eg. player.set() => player)
//   targetType, // Type of object on which the change was made (eg. player.set() => "player")
//   key, // Key of changed value (e.g. player.set("score", 1) => "score")
//   value, // New value
//   prevValue // Previous value
// ) => {
//   // // Example filtering
//   // if (key !== "value") {
//   //   return;
//   // }
// });

// // onAppend is called when the experiment code call the `.append()` method
// // on games, rounds, stages, players, playerRounds or playerStages.
// Empirica.onAppend((

//   // Note the extra isAppend boolean that will allow to differenciate sets and
//   // appends.
