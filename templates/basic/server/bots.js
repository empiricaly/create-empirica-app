  // onStageStart(bot, game, round, stage, players) {},

  // Called during each stage at tick interval (~1s at the moment)
  onStageTick(bot, game, round, stage, secondsRemaining) {}

  // // NOT SUPPORTED A player has changed a value
  // // This might happen a lot!
  // onStagePlayerChange(bot, game, round, stage, players, player) {}

  // // NOT SUPPORTED Called at the end of the stage (after it finished, before onStageEnd/onRoundEnd is called)
  // onStageEnd(bot, game, round, stage, players) {}
